notes forecasting 
- maybe drop at some point close_date and engage_date bc there are new features added : 
datetime feature extraction for both close_date and engage_date 
The new ones like close_year, close_month, etc., are features derived from those columns, not replacements.
Drop only if youâ€™re 100% sure youâ€™ll never use the full date again (not usually recommended in EDA or modeling).
ðŸ”¹ Drop the original columns if:
	â€¢	Youâ€™re only doing static modeling (e.g. classification/regression without time-based components).
	â€¢	Youâ€™ve already extracted all needed features (year, month, etc.).
	â€¢	You want to avoid multicollinearity or unnecessary data.
