Sales-Ops-Auto: Automated Sales Operations Analysis

📊 A data-driven approach to analyzing and optimizing sales pipelines

🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases my ability to analyze sales pipeline data, automate reporting, and apply predictive insights using Python. Although the dataset is fictional, the workflow simulates real-world sales operations analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), automated reporting, and predictive modeling.

🎯 Objectives

✅ Identify key accounts with the highest deal losses.
✅ Analyze sales trends and pipeline inefficiencies.
✅ Automate reporting for sales insights.
✅ (Bonus) Implement a predictive model for deal success.

🛠 Tech Stack
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	•	Jupyter Notebook (Data Analysis & Visualization)
	•	Scikit-learn (Predictive Modeling - optional)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis focuses on lost deals, identifying which accounts contribute the most to revenue loss and understanding patterns in sales performance.

Key Insights
	•	Top Lost Accounts: Identified the accounts with the highest lost deal values.
	•	Deal Distribution: Visualized revenue loss across deals.
	•	Sales Trends: Analyzed seasonal trends and deal stages.

📈 Example Visualization: Distribution of Lost Deal Values

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

lost_deals_df['close_value'].hist(bins=20)
plt.title("Distribution of Lost Deals Value")
plt.xlabel("Close Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()

🔄 Automation & Reporting

To simulate real sales operations automation, I implemented:
✅ Automated summary reports with key metrics.
✅ Scheduled scripts to process and analyze data.
✅ Dynamic dashboards (optional) for visual insights.

Example: Auto-generated summary for lost deals

sum_lost_deals_hott = lost_deals_df[lost_deals_df['account'] == 'Hottechi']['close_value'].sum()
print(f"The sum of all lost deals by Hottechi is: {sum_lost_deals_hott}")

🔮 Predictive Modeling (Bonus Feature)

As an extra step, I implemented a logistic regression model to predict whether a deal would be won or lost based on sales features.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X = df[['deal_size', 'industry', 'stage']]
y = df['status']  # 1 = Won, 0 = Lost
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

✅ Potential Applications:
	•	Predicting which deals are most likely to close successfully.
	•	Helping sales teams prioritize high-value opportunities.

🏆 Key Takeaways

✔ Simulates a real-world sales ops workflow.
✔ Demonstrates automation in sales data processing.
✔ Showcases predictive insights for sales performance.

📌 Next Steps
	•	Improve data quality by adding more realistic sales features.
	•	Expand automation to generate email reports.
	•	Enhance predictive modeling with more advanced ML techniques.
