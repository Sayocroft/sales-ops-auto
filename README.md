# üìä Sales Ops Auto ‚Äì Pipeline Analysis & Forecasting

This project explores a fictional B2B sales pipeline dataset (from Kaggle) to identify patterns in deal success, analyze pipeline health, and forecast future revenue using machine learning and time series methods.

---

## üîç Project Overview

The analysis combines account and sales pipeline data to answer questions like:

- Which companies have the most won/lost deals?
- How balanced is the pipeline across stages?
- What‚Äôs the relationship between company size and deal value?
- Which industries have the highest win rates?
- How can we forecast future revenue?

---

## üß± Datasets Used

All data is fictional and sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The following CSV files are used:

- `accounts.csv`: Company details (e.g., revenue, sector, size)
- `sales_pipeline.csv`: Deal-level sales data (stage, value, dates)
- `sales_teams.csv`: Info on salespeople (not used in this version)
- `products.csv`, `metadata.csv`: Placeholder for future analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify pipeline imbalances (e.g., too many ‚ÄúWon‚Äù deals, not enough top-funnel)
- Detect CRM data quality issues (e.g., missing close values in early stages)
- Assess distribution of close values by industry and company size

### 2. Segmentation & Normalization
- Segment companies into SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise
- Normalize close values by revenue and employee count

### 3. Win Rate Analysis
- Win rates by industry and company size
- Heatmap of performance by industry/segment

### 4. Time Series Analysis
- Detect revenue trends over time
- Use derivatives and moving averages to identify seasonality

### 5. Revenue Forecasting
Implemented 3 models for time-series forecasting:
- **Linear Regression** (basic)
- **ARIMA** (statistical)
- **Prophet** (Facebook‚Äôs library with custom seasonality & holidays)
